Group member 1 - Sonia Wu
I have many years industrial software development experience. That will help me on planning projects, coordinating with teammates. Although web development is a totally new category to me, with my solid analysis and trouble shooting skill, I am confident I can successfully handle this project.

Group member 2 - Mateusz Jachna 
I have little experience with Web Development but I do have some experience coding in C++ and Java. I have experience working in teams and know we will be able to coaperate.
